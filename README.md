# CS330---Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization

My approach to software design is to first think about the problem I am trying to solve and 
who will be using it. From there I decide what "done" looks like. For this project, I first 
decided what scene I wanted to recreate, then looking at each object individually, I planned
out what basic shapes I could use to make those objects. I feel this is a very specific mindset
when creating 3D scenes. It is one I can use on all future graphic design work.

When developing my 3D scene in this project, I heavily relied on iteration. Making small changes,
then running the program to observe those changes. Each iteration informed my next iteration and
by the end of it, I had a solid grasp on how the changes I make to the scene in code will look
at runtime. By the time I got through the last milestone, I was very comfortable with the pipeline
used in this project. 

Computational graphics and visualizations really helped me bridge the gap between the math I learned
in previous classes and how it can be applied in computer science. The skills I learned in this course
are skills I will use in my future projects, as my future classes include Design of Virtual Game Environments.
